# 📚 JAVA DEVELOPER TASK - 1🚀

## ✅ Questions and Answers:

### 1. What is method overloading?
It's like giving many nicknames to the same person. In Java, we can have many methods with the same name, but they look different because they take different numbers or types of things (like numbers or text). It helps Java know what you really want.

### 2. How do you handle divide-by-zero?
Dividing by zero is not allowed. It’s like trying to cut a pizza into zero pieces — it makes no sense! In Java, we check if the number on the bottom is zero. If yes, we don’t divide and maybe show a message like “Can’t divide by zero.”

### 3. Difference between `==` and `.equals()`?
`==` checks if two things are the **same box**. `.equals()` checks if the **inside the box is the same**. So, if two gift boxes look the same but have different toys inside, `==` says “No”, but `.equals()` checks what toy is inside and may say “Yes”.

### 4. What are the basic data types in Java?
These are like types of things Java understands:
- `int` – for numbers like 1, 2, 3  
- `float` – for numbers with dots like 3.14  
- `char` – for letters like ‘A’  
- `boolean` – for true or false  
- `double`, `byte`, `short`, `long` – other types of numbers

### 5. How is Scanner used for input?
Scanner is like a helper who listens to what you type. You write:  
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int num = sc.nextInt();

Now whatever number you type, Java saves it in `num`.

---

### 6. Explain the role of a loop.
Loops are like saying “Do this again and again”. If I say "Clap 5 times", a loop helps me clap 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without writing "clap" 5 times. It saves time.

---

### 7. Difference between `while` and `for` loop?
Both do repeating.  
- `while` is like saying “keep going until you’re tired” — we don’t know how long.  
- `for` is like saying “do this 5 times” — we know the count already.

### 8. What is the JVM?
JVM is like a translator between Java and the computer. It helps your computer understand and run the Java code.

---

### 9. How is Java platform-independent?
Java can run anywhere — like a video that works on phone, TV, or laptop. Because Java makes something called **bytecode**, and JVM can run it on any machine.

---

### 10. How do you debug a Java program?
Debugging is like finding and fixing mistakes. You check your code step-by-step, add print lines, or use special tools to find where it’s going wrong. Like checking your math homework to fix wrong answers.
