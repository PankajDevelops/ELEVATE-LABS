I made a project that’s like a teacher's notebook for keeping track of students. I called it a Student Record Management System. It has a menu where you can choose what you want to do. You can add a new student by typing in their name and grade, and the program gives them a special ID number. You can also see a list of all the students you've added. If you made a mistake, you can update a student's info using their ID. And if a student leaves the school, you can delete their record. It’s a neat way to keep everything organized!
