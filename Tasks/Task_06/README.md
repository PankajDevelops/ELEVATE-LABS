# 📚 JAVA DEVELOPER TASKs🚀

When you open my program, it asks you what you want to do.

You can choose option 1 to see all the notes you've already written. It's like flipping through the pages of your notebook.

If you want to write something new, you pick option 2. The computer will ask you to type your note, and when you press Enter, poof! It saves it.

The coolest part is that it saves everything in a secret file called notes.txt. So, even if you turn off the computer and come back tomorrow, your notes will still be there! It doesn't forget.

Oh, and if you want to start all over, you can pick option 3 to erase everything. It's like getting a brand new, clean notebook. And when you're all done, you just pick option 4 to close the program.
