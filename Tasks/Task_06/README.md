# 📚 JAVA DEVELOPER TASKs🚀

---

I made a cool To-Do List app that you can see and click on, not just boring text in a black window. It's like a real program on the computer!

I made a window, and at the top, there's a box where you can type in what you need to do, like "finish homework" or "walk the dog." Next to it, there's a big "Add Task" button. When you click it, whatever you typed pops into a list in the middle of the window.

If you finish a task, you just click on it in the list, and then you press the "Delete Selected Task" button at the bottom, and poof! It's gone. It was super fun making the buttons actually do stuff!
