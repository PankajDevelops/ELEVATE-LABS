I made a plan for an account that knows how much money it has. It has two main jobs: deposit for putting money in and withdraw for taking money out. Every time money moves, it writes it down in a history list, like a diary for the account.

Then, I made another program to actually use the account. I started a new account, put in some money, and then took some out. I even tried to take out more money than I had, and it correctly said nope. Finally, I had it print out the whole diary and show the final money left.
