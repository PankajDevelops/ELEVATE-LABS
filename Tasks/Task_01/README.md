I made a cool calculator for the computer. It’s pretty simple. You run the program, and it asks you for two numbers. Then, it asks if you want to add, subtract, multiply, or divide them. You type in the sign, like + or -, and it does the math and shows you the answer! The best part is that it asks if you want to do another calculation, so you can keep doing math problems over and over until you tell it to stop.
