# 📚 JAVA DEVELOPER TASKs🚀

---

This console-based Java quiz app is built with two key components: a Question class that defines each quiz question, including its text, options, and the correct answer, and a Quiz class that acts as the quiz master. The Quiz class handles presenting questions, accepting user input, checking answers for correctness, tracking the score, and finally displaying the overall results. It's a straightforward project demonstrating fundamental Java control flow and logic.
