# 📚 JAVA DEVELOPER TASKs🚀

First, I created a template for a Book, which keeps track of its ID, title, author, and whether someone has checked it out. Then, I made a template for a User, which is like a library card that holds a person's name, their ID, and a list of books they've borrowed.

The main part of the project is the Library itself. It's like the main desk where the librarian works. When you run the program, it shows a menu. You can add new books to the shelves, register new people as library users, and see lists of all the books and users. The best part is you can "issue" a book to a user, which means they check it out. When they're done, they can "return" it so it's available for someone else to read!
